# CCD-Optimization-Using-Machine-Learning

# Requirements

All codes contained here use Python3, and the packages listed in requirements.txt to run.

# Usage

There are a few different pieces of code we can use to work on developing the procedure for using machine
learning in optimizing CCDs.

To see how they are used consult the development document, which presents them in order of how the should be
used.  The development doc is in ipynb form.
